1. Roxygen

1.1. Execution

  After installing Roxygen, `R CMD roxygen' or, on Windows, `Rcmd
  roxygen.sh' should be available. Run it above the base of your
  package (hereafter `<package>') like so:

      R CMD roxygen <package>

  or, on Windows:

      Rcmd roxygen.sh <package>

  If `R CMD roxygen' is unavailable, you can invoke Roxygen within R:

      library(roxygen)
      roxygenize('<package>')

  Roxygen creates a package skeleton `<package>.roxygen'; populates
  its `man' directory with Rd files from the source; generates a
  `NAMESPACE'; modifies the Collate field in `DESCRIPTION'; and
  creates call graphs in `inst/doc'.

  You should now be able check, build and install from the new
  directory:

      R CMD check <package>.roxygen

  On Windows, however, you may need to rename the directory.
