* Separate roclet steps into process and output
  * Process should return object that's passed to output
  * Will support better testing

* Get tests working again

* Build proper model of Rd file, so can more easily merge contents from
  separate documentation blocks

* Re-document had roclet, and give it a better name
  
* Write S4 test cases:
  generic documentation
  class documentation
  method documentation - individual, class, generic

* Update todo with my suggested style of working
